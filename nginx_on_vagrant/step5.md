üìç **Notice**
       
   We also have a *Vagrantfile*. This file is responsible for configuring and performing the base setup of a Vagrant box. 
   
   You can find more information about this on [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile)
   
 Let's assume you want to automate the provisioning of a Vagrant box so that Nginx will be installed, configured, and started automatically. 
 
 For larger projects, this will require a special provisioner such as Chef, Puppet, or Ansible. You can find more information on those [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/provisioning).

As a proof-of-concept, we can use some shell scripts. At the end of the vagrant file, you should see  the following lines:
  ```
  #  Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  #  Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
  # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
  #   apt-get update
  #   apt-get install -y apache2
  # SHELL
  ```

  We need to uncomment the last 4 lines, starting with *config.vm.provision*, and ending with *SHELL*.
  
  You can replace the two *apt-get* commands with whatever you want the virtual machine to do during its initial setup. In our case, we want it to install nginx and copy the *.html*, and the configuration files we provided. 
  
  The final script should look somewhat like this:
  
  ```
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y nginx
    sudo cp /vagrant/index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    sudo cp /vagrant/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    sudo service nginx start
  SHELL
  ```
  
We need to destroy the virtual machine using `vagrant destroy`{{execute interrupt}}

Now we will remake the virtual machine using `vagrant up --provider=docker`{{execute interrupt}}

We can now check if Nginx works by running the following commands (the same as in step 4):

`vagrant ssh`{{execute interrupt}}

`wget http://127.0.0.1`{{execute interrupt}}

`cat index.html`{{execute interrupt}}

`exit`{{execute interrupt}}

If everything works then...

üéâ **Congratulations!** üéâ *You have fully automated the process!*
